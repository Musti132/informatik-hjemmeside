        <v-spacer></v-spacer><p>1. Introduction This policy sets out how we
        collect, use and protect the personal data of our employees, customers
        and other individuals with whom we interact. </p><v-spacer></v-spacer><p>2. Data Protection
        Principles We will comply with the eight data protection principles when
        handling personal data: a) Personal data must be processed lawfully,
        fairly and in a transparent manner. b)
        <v-spacer></v-spacer>
        <p>Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further
        processed in a way that is incompatible with those purposes. c) Personal
        data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in
        relation to the purposes for which it is processed. d) Personal data
        must be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable
        step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate,
        having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, is erased or
        rectified without delay. e) </p>
        <v-spacer></v-spacer><p>Personal data must be kept in a form which
        permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary
        for the purposes for which the personal data is processed. Personal data
        may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be
        processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest,
        scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes
        subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
        organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the
        rights and freedoms of the data subject. f) </p>Personal data must be
        processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal
        data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing
        and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate
        technical or organisational measures. g) The controller must take
        responsibility for and be able to demonstrate compliance with the
        principles. </p><v-spacer></v-spacer><p>3. Rights of Data Subjects Data subjects have the following
        rights in relation to their personal data: a) The right to be informed
        about the processing of their personal data. b) The right of access to
        their personal data. c) The right to rectification of their personal
        data. d) The right to erasure of their personal data. e) The right to
        restrict processing of their personal data. f) The right to data
        portability. g) The right to object to the processing of their personal
        data. h) The right not to be subject to automated decision-making,
        including profiling. i) The right to withdraw consent at any time, where
        consent is the basis for processing personal data. </p><v-spacer></v-spacer><p>4. Data Collection
        and Use We collect and use personal data for the following purposes: a)
        To fulfil our contractual obligations to employees, customers and other
        individuals with whom we have a relationship. b) To comply with our
        legal obligations. c) For our legitimate business interests, where these
        are not overridden by the rights and interests of the data subject. </p><v-spacer></v-spacer><p>5.
        Data Sharing We may share personal data with the following categories of
        recipient: a) Our employees and contractors, where necessary for the
        performance of their duties. b) Our business partners, for example in
        the context of joint marketing initiatives. c) Third-party service
        providers, for example our IT hosting and support providers. d)
        Regulatory authorities and law enforcement bodies, where required by
        law. </p><v-spacer></v-spacer><p>6. Data Security We have put in place appropriate security measures
        to prevent personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed
        in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit
        access to personal data to those employees, contractors and other third
        parties who have a business need to know. They will only process
        personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of
        confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any
        suspected data security breach and will notify the relevant regulatory
        authorities and data subjects of a breach where we are legally required
        to do so. </p><v-spacer></v-spacer><p>7. Data Retention We will only retain personal data for as
        long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including
        for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting
        requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal
        data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal
        data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of
        the personal data, the purposes for which we process the personal data
        and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
        applicable legal requirements. </p><v-spacer></v-spacer><p>8. Data Protection Officer We have
        appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to oversee our compliance with
        this policy and the GDPR. The contact details of our DPO are as follows:
